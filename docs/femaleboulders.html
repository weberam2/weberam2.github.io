<div id="v15" class="section level1">
<h1>V15 Club</h1>
<p>Currently it seems as though four women have climbed a V15 boulder: Ashima Shirashi with two (!) - Sleepy Rave and Horizon; Kaddi Lehman with Kriptos; Mishka Ishi with Byaku-dou; and Oriane Bertone with Satan i helvete bas.</p>
</div>
<div id="who" class="section level1">
<h1>Who Is the Strongest Female Boulderer Ever?</h1>
<p>The following are two bar plots based on the data in the above list showing who has sent the most hard boulder problems and who has put up the most hard boulder first ascents (FAs).</p>
<p><img src="femaleboulders_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /> <img src="femaleboulders_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The strongest climber by most hard boulder sends is Alex Puccio with 47 ascents; 12 more than the Isabelle Faus with the second most ascents. However, Isabelle Faus has the most FAs with 6; 5 more than Alex Puccio, and an impressive amount of hard sends to her name. Finally, as stated above, Ashima Shirashi has climbed two V15s, along with Kaddi Lehman, Mishka Ishi, and Oriane Bertone who have climbed one each - something that neither Alex Puccio nor Isabelle Faus has done.</p>
</div>
<div id="trends" class="section level1">
<h1>Trends Over Time</h1>
<p><img src="femaleboulders_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Starting in 2002 with an ascent of Travesia de Balzola in Spain by Josune Bereziartu, the number of women to have climbed V13 or higher has consistently gone up, especially in 2014. I must have my number wrong because something crazy seems to have happened in 2020. Although with the pandemic and the olympics, it’s hard to say.</p>
</div>
<div id="howmany" class="section level1">
<h1>How Many Women Can Climb V13 or Higher?</h1>
<p><img src="femaleboulders_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>At the moment, there are 47 women in the world that have sent V13. After which there is a steep drop off, with 12 having sent V14, and 4 having sent V15.</p>
</div>
<div id="country" class="section level1">
<h1>Which Countries Have the Hardest Boulder Problems for Women?</h1>
<p><img src="femaleboulders_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The Top Countries with the hardest female sends are the United States, South Africa, Switzerland, and France.</p>
</div>
<div id="age" class="section level1">
<h1>What About Age?</h1>
<p>What is the age of strong female climbers today?</p>
<p><img src="femaleboulders_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The mean, median and mode age of strong female climbers today is 28, 29, and 24, respectively.</p>
<p>The youngest V13 female climber today is 16 years old. The oldest V13 female climber today is 50 years old.</p>
<div id="what-about-stats-on-how-old-they-are-when-they-send-the-route" class="section level2">
<h2>What about stats on how old they are when they send the route?</h2>
<p><img src="femaleboulders_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The mean, median and mode age of strong female climbers when they sent is 24, 25, and 25, respectively.</p>
<p>The youngest age to have climbed V13 or higher is 10 years old. The oldest age to have climbed V13 or higher is 35 years old.</p>
<p><br /> <br /></p>
<p><em>In order to create this list, I used <a href="www.8a.nu">8a.nu</a> clicked on their ‘Ascents’ tab, clicked ‘Bouldering’ for the discipline, clicked ‘Female’ for gender, filtered grades from 8b and higher, and copied the table:</em></p>
<p><em>However, not all athlete’s record their bouldering ascents in 8a.nu. Another great resource was <a href="https://onbouldering.com/8b-senders-ladies-club/">https://onbouldering.com/8b-senders-ladies-club/</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>Finally, I then tried to standardize all entries, remove errors, and add in send dates. Ultimately this is still a work in progress, and if you see any errors, please reach out.</em></p>
<p><em>Special shout-out to Andrew Leyland for extensive help in filling out the spreadsheet.</em></p>
