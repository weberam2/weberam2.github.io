<p><em><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 2022. If you notice
anything that is an error, or you would like to help improve the list,
please let me know.</em></p>
<p><em>[Note: this site and list are still under construction. Things I
still need to do: <br> - Fix table of contents <br> - Add ability for
users to comment]</em></p>
<p>The following is an attempt to update <a
href="https://www.99boulders.com/author/alex">Alex Beale</a>’s fantastic
list of <a
href="https://www.99boulders.com/hardest-boulder-problems">The World’s
Hardest Boulder Problems</a>, which attempted to collect the hardest
boulder problems with a lower cutoff grade of V15 (8C).</p>
<p>As of January 2022, Mr. Beale has not updated the site past March of
2019. This is really unfortunate as hard bouldering has really jumped
starting in 2019 (which show). The following is my attempt to create the
most up-to-date list of hard boulder sends.</p>
<p>As it stands, there are currently 826 entries; of which 826 have
dates.</p>
<p>As of this writing, there now appear to be 205 climbs rated
<strong>V15 (8C)</strong>, 38 climbs rated <strong>V16 (8C+)</strong>,
and 2 climbs rated <strong>V17 (9A)</strong>.</p>
<p>Compared to Alex Beale’s list, that is 26 more V16s than there were
in March 2019!</p>
<p>The most climbed <strong>V15</strong> boulder is <strong>Story Of Two
Worlds</strong> with 27 ascents; followed by <strong>Big Island</strong>
and <strong>Dreamtime (post break)</strong> with 24 and 21 ascents,
respectively.</p>
<p>The most climbed <strong>V16</strong> boulder is <strong>Creature
from the Black Lagoon</strong> with 11 ascents; followed by
<strong>Sleepwalker</strong> and <strong>Off the Wagon Sit</strong> with
8 and 7 ascents, respectively.</p>

<div id="hardest" class="section level1">
<h1>The World’s Hardest Boulder Problem</h1>
<p>Based solely on grade, the title of world’s hardest boulder problem
is currently shared by two problems: <a
href="https://climbing-history.org/climb/826/burden-of-dreams">Burden of
Dreams</a> and <a
href="https://climbing-history.org/climb/1116/return-of-the-sleepwalker">Return
of the Sleepwalker</a>. Both are currently graded V17 (9A).</p>
<p>Both problems have only one ascent. Nalle Hukkataival sent Burden of
Dreams in October 2016, making it the first problem ever to receive a
proposed grade of V17 (9A). Daniel Woods sent Return of the Sleepwalker
in March 2021.</p>
<p>Two other problems have been graded V17, to then be downgraded. <a
href="https://climbing-history.org/climb/849/soudain-seul">The Big
Island (sit)</a>, first climbed by Simon Lorenzi in February 2021 as
V17, has since been downgraded by Nico Pelorson in April 2021 (I have
given this climb a grade of 16.5). <a
href="https://climbing-history.org/climb/827/no-kpote-only">No Kpote
Only</a>, first climbed by Charles Albert (barefoot!) in 2019 as V17,
has seen two repeats, with the most recent suggesting a downgrade of V15
(Nico Pelorson again; I have recorded the grade as V15 here).</p>
</div>
<div id="strongest" class="section level1">
<h1>Who Is the Strongest Male Boulderer Ever?</h1>
<p>The following are two bar plots based on the data in the above list
showing who has sent the most hard boulder problems and who has put up
the most hard boulder first ascents (FAs).</p>
<p><img src="boulders_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" />
<img src="boulders_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The strongest climber by most hard boulder sends is Daniel Woods with
43 ascents; 5 more than the Jimmy Webb with the second most ascents.
However, Dai Koyamada has the most FAs with 23; 5 more than Daniel
Woods, and an impressive amount of hard sends to his name. Finally, both
Daniel Woods and Nalle Hukkataival are the only climbers to have sent a
V17.</p>
</div>
<div id="trends" class="section level1">
<h1>Trends Over Time</h1>
<p><img src="boulders_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Starting in NA with some of the first consensus V15s (<a
href="https://climbing-history.org/climb/1143/black-eagle-assis">Black
Eagle SD</a> and <a
href="https://climbing-history.org/climb/107/monkey-wedding">Monkey
Wedding</a>, both FAs by Fred Nicole; <a
href="https://climbing-history.org/climb/138/dreamtime-(pre-break)">Dreamtime</a>
by Fred Nicole was the first V15 in 2000, but was subsequently
downgraded to V14…until around 2010 when a hold broke taking it back to
V15), there was a flat year-to-year addition of hard boulders (with the
exception of a jump in 2004), only to start growing around 2010. 2013
appears to be an outlier for some reason (perhaps I have mixed up 2012
and 2013 dates). Finally, starting in 2019, we have a big bump in hard
boulder sends…</p>
<p>It took two years from the first suggested V15 (Dreamtime
(pre-break)) to a consensus V15 (Black Eagle SD / Monkey Wedding). For
V16, the first suggested problem appears to have been Tonino ’78, first
sent by Mauro Calibani in 2004. But it wouldn’t be until 2016 (12 years
later) when Daniel Woods put up <a
href="https://climbing-history.org/climb/1091/creature-from-the-black-lagoon">Creature
from the Black Lagoon</a>, the world’s first consensus V16.</p>
<p>Nalle Hukkataival’s <a
href="https://climbing-history.org/climb/826/burden-of-dreams">Burden of
Dreams</a>, first sent in 2016, has yet to see a repeat to confirm the
grade (6 years and counting). Although, I have a sneaky suspicion we
will see the first confirmation of a V17 with a repeat of <a
href="https://climbing-history.org/climb/1116/return-of-the-sleepwalker">Return
of the Sleepwalker</a> sometime this year…(fingers crossed)</p>

<h1>How Many Men Can Climb V15 or Higher?</h1>
<p><img src="boulders_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>At the moment, there are more than 200 climbers in the world that
have sent V15. After which there is a steep drop off, with 20 unique
climbers having sent V15/16, 38 having sent V16, and 3 and 2 having sent
V16/17 and V17, respectively.</p>
<p>With hard boulders, downgrading is common, as new climbers come along
and find better/easier beta. Nalle wrote a fantastic <a

<p><em>In order to create this list, I first copied Mr. Beale’s list.
Then, realizing that <a
href="https://github.com/vishaalagartha/8a_scraper">scraping</a> <a
href="https://www.8a.nu/">8a.nu</a> is against their terms of service, I
simply clicked on their ‘Ascents’ tab, clicked ‘Bouldering’ for the
discipline, filtered grades from 8c and higher, and copied the
table:</em></p>
<div class="float">
<img src="images/8a.png" alt="8a.nu filter" />
<div class="figcaption">8a.nu filter</div>
</div>
<p><em>However, not all athlete’s record their bouldering ascents in
8a.nu (Alex Megos being one example). Another great resource was <a
href="https://climbing-history.org/">https://climbing-history.org/</a>,
where oftentimes searching for a popular boulder problem would reveal
additional sends not listed in 8a.nu.</em></p>
<p><em>Finally, I then tried to standardize all entries (James Webb
vs. Jimmy Webb), remove errors, and add in send dates. Ultimately this
is still a work in progress, and if you see any errors, please reach
out.</em></p>
<p><em>Special shout-out to Andrew Leyland for extensive help in filling
out the spreadsheet. And for those curious, I used <a
