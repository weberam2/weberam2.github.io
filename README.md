## Hard Boulders

These are now out of date, unfortunately. I'm not sure how much longer I will keep these up.

## Future Climbs

These are mostly the [Fifty Classic Climbs of North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifty_Classic_Climbs_of_North_America), a visual guide with some grades, and the upcoming weather. This is so I can better estimate which climb has the best chance of success given the conditions.

It is super slow... which I guess I shouldn't have used ShinyR?

Anyways, to get this monstrosity working, run this in the main folder: `Rscript renderapp.R`
