# Alex Weber's Personal Website

![](images/alexpic_tricouni.jpg)

Since 2019, I have been an Assistant Professor (Partner-Track) at [UBC](https://pediatrics.med.ubc.ca/) and [BC Children's Hospital Research Institute](https://www.bcchr.ca/), interested in using quantitative MRI methods to study and improve brain development in newborns and children.

You can visit my lab's website [here](https://weberlab.github.io/), and see my CV [here](https://github.com/weberam2/UBC_Annotated_CV/blob/main/UBC_CV.pdf).

In my spare time, I like to learn new things and have adventures outside. My
main hobbies have been climbing, running, snowboarding, ice climbing, hiking,
backcountry camping, sailing and more. I hope to one day learn to paraglide.
